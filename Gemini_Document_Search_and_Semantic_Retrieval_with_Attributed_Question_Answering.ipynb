I later verified that the version of unstructured available from PyPl is missing this particular file from the Dec 14 release. As a result, installing from source is necessary to get the full package with PDF support. I'm sure this will get fixed soon. Alternately, you can downgrade to the previous release version of unstructured, provided you know that that is 0.11.2. My packages above reflect this downgrade. The latest unstructured can be installed from git using the code below."

QUESTION: \\'How does transformative use factor into the court\\'s fair use analysis?\\'\\nPASSAGES: \\'15  16 ANDY WARHOL FOUNDATION FOR VISUAL ARTS, INC.  v. GOLDSMITH Opinion of the Court  in the sense that copying is socially useful ex post. Many secondary works add something new. That alone does not render such uses fair. Rather, the first factor (which is just one factor in a larger analysis) asks “whether and to what extent” the use at issue has a purpose or character different from the original. Campbell, 510 U. S., at 579 (emphasis added). The larger the difference, the more likely the first factor weighs in favor of fair use. The smaller the differ- ence, the less likely.  A use that has a further purpose or different character is said to be “ ‘transformative.’ ” Ibid. (quoting P. Leval, To- ward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1105, 1111 (1990) (hereinafter Leval)). As before, “transformative- ness” is a matter of degree. See Campbell, 510 U. S., at 579. That is important because the word “transform,” though not included in §107, appears elsewhere in the Copyright Act. The statute defines derivative works, which the copyright owner has “the exclusive righ[t]” to prepare, §106(2), to in- clude “any other form in which a work may be recast, trans- formed, or adapted,” §101. In other words, the owner has a right to derivative transformations of her work. Such transformations may be substantial, like the adaptation of a book into a movie. To be sure, this right is “[s]ubject to” fair use. §106; see also §107. The two are not mutually exclusive. But an overbroad concept of transformative use, one that includes any further purpose, or any different character, would narrow the copyright owner’s exclusive right to create derivative works. To preserve that right, the degree of transformation required to make “transformative” use of an original must go beyond that required to qualify as a derivative.5  ——————  5 In theory, the question of transformative use or transformative pur- pose can be separated from the question whether there has been trans- formation of a work. In practice, however, the two may overlap. Com- pare, e.g., Núñez v. Caribbean Int’l News Corp., 235 F. 3d 18, 21–23 (CA1  Cite as: 598 U. S. ____ (2023)  Opinion of the Court  Source: 21-869_87ad.pdf #20) 1  Campbell did describe a transformative use as one that “alter[s] the first [work] with new expression, meaning, or message.” 510 U. S., at 579; see also Google, 593 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24). That description paraphrased Judge Leval’s law review article, which referred to “new infor- mation, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings.” Leval 1111. (Judge Leval contrasted such additions with secondary uses that “merely repackag[e]” the original. Ibid.) But Campbell cannot be read to mean that §107(1) weighs in favor of any use that adds some new expression, meaning, or message.  Otherwise, “transformative use” would swallow the copy- right owner’s exclusive right to prepare derivative works. Many derivative works, including musical arrangements, film and stage adaptions, sequels, spinoffs, and others that “recast, transfor[m] or adap[t]” the original, §101, add new expression, meaning or message, or provide new infor- mation, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings. That is an intractable problem for AWF’s interpretation of transformative use. The first fair use factor would not  Cite as: 598 U. S. ____ (2023)  Opinion of the Court  weigh in favor of a commercial remix of Prince’s “Purple Rain” just because the remix added new expression or had a different aesthetic. A film or musical adaptation, like that of Alice Walker’s The Color Purple, might win awards for its “significant creative contribution”; alter the meaning of a classic novel; and add “important new expression,” such as images, performances, original music, and lyrics. Post, at 11, 23 (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). But that does not in itself dispense with the need for licensing.17  Source: 21-869_87ad.pdf #33) Cite as: 598 U. S. ____ (2023)  KAGAN, J., dissenting  of fair use. Id., at 583. And that was so even though the rap song was, as everyone agreed, recorded and later sold for profit. See id., at 573.  Just two Terms ago, in Google, we made all the same points. We quoted Campbell in explaining that the factor 1 inquiry is “whether the copier’s use ‘adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering’ the copyrighted work ‘with new expression, meaning, or mes- sage.’ ” 593 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24). We again described “a copying use that adds something new and important” as “transformative.” Ibid. We reiterated that protecting transformative uses “stimulate[s] creativity” and thus “ful- fill[s] the objective of copyright law.” Ibid. (quoting Leval 1111). And then we gave an example. Yes, of course, we pointed to Andy Warhol. (The majority claims not to be em- barrassed by this embarrassing fact because the specific reference was to his Soup Cans, rather than his celebrity images. But drawing a distinction between a “commentary on consumerism”—which is how the majority describes his soup canvases, ante, at 27—and a commentary on celebrity culture, i.e., the turning of people into consumption items, is slicing the baloney pretty thin.) Finally, the Court con- ducted the first-factor inquiry it had described. Google had replicated Sun Microsystems’ computer code as part of a “commercial endeavor,” done “for commercial profit.” 593 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 27). No matter, said the Court. “[M]any common fair uses are indisputably commercial.” Ibid. What mattered instead was that Google had used Sun’s code to make “something new and important”: a “highly creative and innovative” software platform. Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 24–25). The use of the code, the Court held, was therefore “transformative” and “point[ed] toward fair use.” Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 25, 28).  Campbell and Google also illustrate the difference it can make in the world to protect transformative works through fair use. Easy enough to say (as the majority does, see ante,  15  16 ANDY WARHOL FOUNDATION FOR VISUAL ARTS, INC.  v. GOLDSMITH KAGAN, J., dissenting  Source: 21-869_87ad.pdf #64)\\'\\n\\nANSWER:\\n'"

In his early career, Warhol worked as a commercial illustrator and became experienced in varied techniques of reproduction. By night, he used those techniques\\342\\200\\224in particular, the silkscreen\\342\\200\\224to create his own art. His own\\342\\200\\224even though in one sense not. The silkscreen enabled him to make brilliantly novel art out of existing \\342\\200\\234images carefully selected from popular culture.\\342\\200\\235 D. De Salvo, God Is in the Details, in Andy Warhol Prints 22 (4th rev. ed. 2003). The works he produced, connecting traditions of fine art with mass culture, depended on \\342\\200\\234ap- propriation[s]\\342\\200\\235: The use of \\342\\200\\234elements of an extant image[ ] is Warhol\\342\\200\\231s entire modus operandi.\\342\\200\\235 B. Gopnik, Artistic Ap- propriation vs. Copyright Law, N. Y. Times, Apr. 6, 2021, p. C4 (internal quotation marks omitted). And with that m.o., he changed modern art; his appropriations and his originality were flipsides of each other.

As readers are by now aware, the majority opinion is trained on this dissent in a way ma- jority opinions seldom are. Maybe that makes the majority opinion self- refuting? After all, a dissent with \\342\\200\\234no theory\\342\\200\\235 and \\342\\200\\234[n]o reason\\342\\200\\235 is not one usually thought to merit pages of commentary and fistfuls of come- back footnotes. Ante, at 36. In any event, I\\342\\200\\231ll not attempt to rebut point for point the majority\\342\\200\\231s varied accusations; instead, I\\342\\200\\231ll mainly rest on my original submission. I\\342\\200\\231ll just make two suggestions about reading what follows. First, when you see that my description of a precedent differs from the majority\\342\\200\\231s, go take a look at the decision. Second, when you come across an argument that you recall the majority took issue with, go back to its response and ask yourself about the ratio of reasoning to ipse dixit. With those two recommendations, I\\342\\200\\231ll take my chances on readers\\342\\200\\231 good judgment.\\n\\nCite as: 598 U. S. ____ (2023)\\n\\nKAGAN, J., dissenting\"\n",

He began with a publicity photograph of the actress. And then he went to work. He reframed the image, zooming in on Monroe\\342\\200\\231s face to \\342\\200\\234produc[e] the disembodied effect of a cinematic close-up.\\342\\200\\235 1 App. 161 (expert declaration).\\n\\nAt that point, he produced a high-contrast, flattened image on a sheet of clear acetate.

The same high-contrast image was then reproduced in negative on a silkscreen, designed\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\nANDY WARHOL FOUNDATION FOR VISUAL ARTS, INC. v.

Warhol would \\342\\200\\234place the screen face down on the canvas, pour ink onto the back of the mesh, and use a squeegee to pull the ink through the weave and onto the canvas.\\342\\200\\235 Id., at 164. On some of his Marilyns (there are many), he reordered the process\\342\\200\\224first ink, then color, then (perhaps) ink again. See id., at 165\\342\\200\\223 166.

Of course, meaning in great art is contestable and contested (as is the premise that an artwork is great).

In 1984, Vanity Fair commissioned Warhol to create a portrait based on a black-and-white photograph taken by noted photographer Lynn Goldsmith:\\n\\nAs he did in the Marilyn series, Warhol cropped the photo, so that Prince\\342\\200\\231s head fills the whole frame: It thus becomes \\342\\200\\234disembodied,\\342\\200\\235 as if \\342\\200\\234magically suspended in space.\\342\\200\\235 Id., at\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\nANDY WARHOL FOUNDATION FOR VISUAL ARTS, INC. v.

That image isolated and exaggerated the darkest details of Prince\\342\\200\\231s head; it also reduced his \\342\\200\\234natural, angled position,\\342\\200\\235 presenting him in a more face-forward way. Id., at 223. Warhol traced, painted, and inked, as earlier described. See supra, at 5\\342\\200\\2236. He also made a second silkscreen, based on his tracings; the ink he passed through that screen left differently colored, out-of-kilter lines around Prince\\342\\200\\231s face and hair (a bit hard to see in the reproduction below\\342\\200\\224more pronounced in the original). Altogether, Warhol made 14 prints and two drawings\\342\\200\\224the Prince series\\342\\200\\224in a range of unnatural, lurid hues. See Appendix, ante, at 39. Vanity Fair chose the Purple Prince to accompany an article on the musician. Thirty-two years later, just after Prince died, Cond\\303\\251 Nast paid Warhol (now actually his foundation, see supra, at 1, n. 1) to use the Orange Prince on the cover of a special commemorative magazine.

Further distinguishing between parody and satire, the Court explained that \\342\\200\\234[p]arody needs to mimic an original to make its point, and so has some claim to use the creation of its vic- tim\\342\\200\\231s (or collective victims\\342\\200\\231) imagination, whereas satire can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of borrow- ing.\\342\\200\\235 Id., at 580\\342\\200\\223581.

Rather, the Soup Cans series uses Campbell\\342\\200\\231s copyrighted work for an artistic commentary on consumerism, a purpose that is orthogonal to advertising soup. The use therefore does not supersede the objects of the advertising logo.15\\n\\nMoreover, a further justification for Warhol\\342\\200\\231s use of Campbell\\342\\200\\231s logo is apparent. His Soup Cans series targets the logo. That is, the original copyrighted work is, at least in part, the object of Warhol\\342\\200\\231s commentary. It is the very nature of Campbell\\342\\200\\231s copyrighted logo\\342\\200\\224well known to the public, designed to be reproduced, and a symbol of an every- day item for mass consumption\\342\\200\\224that enables the commen- tary. Hence, the use of the copyrighted work not only serves a completely different purpose, to comment on consumer- ism rather than to advertise soup, it also \\342\\200\\234conjures up\\342\\200\\235 the original work to \\342\\200\\234she[d] light\\342\\200\\235 on the work itself, not just the subject of the work.

That use would share much the same purpose of Campbell\\342\\200\\231s logo, even though Soup Cans has some new meaning or message. This hypothetical, though fanciful, is parallel to the situation here: Both Goldsmith and AWF sold images of Prince (AWF\\342\\200\\231s copying Goldsmith\\342\\200\\231s) to magazines to illustrate stories about the celebrity, which is the typical use made of Goldsmith\\342\\200\\231s photographs.\\n\\n16 The dissent either does not follow, or chooses to ignore, this analysis. The point is not simply that the Soup Cans series comments on consumer culture, similar to how Warhol\\342\\200\\231s celebrity images comment on celebrity culture.

Rather, as the discussion makes clear, the degree of difference in purpose and character between Campbell\\342\\200\\231s soup label and Warhol\\342\\200\\231s painting is nearly absolute. Plus, Warhol\\342\\200\\231s use targets Campbell\\342\\200\\231s logo, at least in part.

GOLDSMITH Opinion of the Court\\n\\nB\\n\\nAWF contends, however, that the purpose and character of its use of Goldsmith\\342\\200\\231s photograph weighs in favor of fair use because Warhol\\342\\200\\231s silkscreen image of the photograph, like the Campbell\\342\\200\\231s Soup Cans series, has a new meaning or message. The District Court, for example, understood the Prince Series works to portray Prince as \\342\\200\\234an iconic, larger-than-life figure.\\342\\200\\235 382 F. Supp. 3d, at 326. AWF also asserts that the works are a comment on celebrity. In par- ticular, \\342\\200\\234Warhol\\342\\200\\231s Prince Series conveys the dehumanizing nature of celebrity.\\342\\200\\235 Brief for Petitioner 44.

In order for a use to be considered fair, it must be transformative, meaning that it must add something new to the original work and not simply be a copy of it. The use must also be non-commercial or only minimally commercial.\\n\\nIn the case of Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v.

In holding that par- ody may be fair use, the Court explained that \\342\\200\\234parody has an obvious claim to transformative value\\342\\200\\235 because \\342\\200\\234it can provide social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and, in the process, creating a new one.\\342\\200\\235 510 U.

The Court found it necessary to determine whether 2 Live Crew\\342\\200\\231s transformation rose to the level of parody, a distinct purpose of commenting on the original or criticizing it. Further distinguishing between parody and satire, the Court explained that \\342\\200\\234[p]arody needs to mimic an original to make its point, and so has some claim to use the creation of its vic- tim\\342\\200\\231s (or collective victims\\342\\200\\231) imagination, whereas satire can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of borrow- ing.\\342\\200\\235 Id., at 580\\342\\200\\223581.

First, the fact that a use is commercial as opposed to nonprofit is an additional element of the first fair use factor. The commercial nature of a use is relevant, but not dispositive.

Compare, for example, a film adaptation of Gone With the Wind with a novel, The Wind Done Gone, that \\342\\200\\234inverts\\342\\200\\235 the original\\342\\200\\231s \\342\\200\\234portrait of race relations\\342\\200\\235 to expose its \\342\\200\\234romantic, idealized\\342\\200\\235 portrayal of the antebellum South.

See R. Storr & C. Armstrong, Lunch With Olympia (2016).

Like satire that does not target an original work, AWF\\342\\200\\231s asserted commentary \\342\\200\\234can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of bor- rowing.\\342\\200\\235 Id., at 581. Moreover, because AWF\\342\\200\\231s commercial use of Goldsmith\\342\\200\\231s photograph to illustrate a magazine about Prince is so similar to the photograph\\342\\200\\231s typical use, a particularly compelling justification is needed. Yet AWF offers no independent justification, let alone a compelling one, for copying the photograph, other than to convey a new meaning or message. As explained, that alone is not enough for the first factor to favor fair use.\"\n",
